# Scope

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access,
in order to facilitate carbon emissions calculations and decarbonization efforts.

See the [Use Cases](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/use-cases) for which we are writing specifications
to address, along with what data types and functionalities will need to be specified to accommodate those use
cases.

See also the items specifically [not in scope](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/use-cases#not-in-scope).

Any changes of Scope or Use Cases are not retroactive.
