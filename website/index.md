# Customer Data Working Group (WG1)

This is the homepage of the [Customer Data Working Group (WG1)](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Customer-Data),
part of the
[Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/carbon-data-specification-cds/),
an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

## Scope

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access,
in order to facilitate carbon emissions calculations and decarbonization efforts.

## Use Cases

We have defined several broad categories of [use cases](/use-cases) we will focus on addressing,
along with what customer data types and functionalities will need to be specified to accommodate
those use cases.

* `Use Case 1` - [Carbon Accounting](/use-cases#use-case-carbon-accounting)
* `Use Case 2` - [Decarbonization Projects](/use-cases#use-case-decarbonization-projects)
* `Use Case 3` - [Distributed Grid Flexibility](/use-cases#use-case-distributed-flexibility)
* `Use Case 4` - [Building Benchmarking](/use-cases#use-case-benchmarking)

We've also made a list of what data and functionality is specifically [not in scope](/use-cases#not-in-scope).

## Specifications

These are the official [specifications](/specs) written by this working group.
