# Customer Data Working Group (WG1)

This is the homepage of the [Customer Data Working Group (WG1)](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Customer-Data),
part of the
[Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/carbon-data-specification-cds/),
an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

## Scope <a id="scope" href="#scope" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access,
in order to facilitate carbon emissions calculations and decarbonization efforts.

## Use Cases <a id="use-cases" href="#use-cases" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

We have defined several broad categories of [use cases]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}) we will focus on addressing,
along with what customer data types and functionalities will need to be specified to accommodate
those use cases.

* `Use Case 1` - [Carbon Accounting]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-carbon-accounting)
* `Use Case 2` - [Decarbonization Projects]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-decarbonization-projects)
* `Use Case 3` - [Distributed Grid Flexibility]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-distributed-flexibility)
* `Use Case 4` - [Building Benchmarking]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#use-case-benchmarking)

We've also made a list of what data and functionality is specifically [not in scope]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#not-in-scope).

## Specifications <a id="specs" href="#specs" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

These are the official [specifications]({{ "/specs" | relative_url }}) written by this working group.

NOTE: It's okay if you're not yet an [LFESS member]({{ "/lfess" | relative_url }}) and comment on something (spec, issue, pull request, mailing list, slack discussion, etc.), and we want your input to be incorporated into our specifications. We'll just ask you to [join LFESS]({{ "/lfess" | relative_url }}#join) before we can merge your suggestions into the specifications.
