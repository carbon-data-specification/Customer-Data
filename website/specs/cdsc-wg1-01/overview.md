# Server Metadata - Overview

This is a summary overview of [`cdsc-wg1-01`]({{ "/specs/cdsc-wg1-01" | relative_url }}), which
describes how utility customer data servers ("Servers") provide a structured reference of
information about them, the functionality they offer, and how other entities ("Clients") can
interoperate with them.

**NOTE:** Utility customer data servers ("Servers") are not always run by utilities themselves. They
could be other types of energy companies, such as electric retailers or community choice aggregators
(CCAs). They can also be centralized entities such as state-run data warehouses or private
infrastructure providers. Throughout this overview, the term "utility or entity" is used instead of
just "utility" to describe the organizations providing access to utility customer data.

## Background <a id="background" href="#background" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

There are thousands of utilities serving customers across the world, and each has their own way of
organizing and structuring customer data. For [use case]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }})
companies needing to obtain customer data, an efficient means of discovering, registering, and
interoperating with these utilities is needed.

## Metadata Endpoint <a id="metadata-endpoint" href="#metadata-endpoint" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

Server metedata is provided under the [well-known url](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615)
`"/.well-known/carbon-data-spec.json`. The response is a [structured object](#metadata-structure)
containing information about the server, what functionality it offers, and how to interoperate with
it.

#### Metadata Structure <a id="metadata-structure" href="#metadata-structure" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

Overall information about the Server is included at the object root level:

* `cds_metadata_version` - _string_ - (required) Which version of server metadata structure this server follows (currently `v1` is the only version)
* `updated` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (required) When this metadata object was last modified.
* `id` - _string_ - (required) A self-assigned globally unique identifier for the utility or entity (e.g. "demoutility")
* `name` - _string_ - (required) The name of the utility or entity (e.g. "Demo Gas & Electric")
* `description` - _string_ - (required) A brief description about the utility or entity (e.g. "An electric and gas utility serving customers in Northern California")
* `website` - _URL_ - (required) Where users can learn more about the utility or entity and its data access capabilities
* `documentation` - _URL_ - (required) Where users can find the utility or entity's technical reference documentation
* `coverage` - _URL_ - (optional) Where to find the structured [Coverage](#coverage-endpoint) details for the utility or entity
* `infrastructure_types` - _Array[[InfrastructureType](#infrastructure-types)]_ - (required) A list of Infrastructure Types that are applicable to this utility or entity
* `commodity_types` - _Array[[CommodityType](#commodity-types)]_ - (required) A list of Commodity Types that are applicable to this utility or entity
* `capabilities` - _Array[[Capability](#capabilities)]_ - (required) What Carbon Data Specification functionality the utility or entity supports

Other components are listed in the `capabilities`, where each listed component can add additional
metadata fields, prefixed with their capability name. For example, the `oauth` capability will add
additional metadata fields prefixed with `oauth_*`.

#### Infrastructure Types <a id="infrastructure-types" href="#infrastructure-types" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

* `distribution_utility` - A electric, natural gas, and/or water utility that distributes the utility service to the end customer (e.g. "who maintains the wires to your house")
* `metering_provider` - An entity that maintains the utility metering infrastructure and/or reads end customer meters (e.g. "who reads your meter")
* `supplier` - An energy supplier for the end customer (e.g. "who you buy power from")
* `central_repository` - A government mandated entity that collects customer usage information into a centralized repository for re-distribution (e.g. a state-level meter data warehouse for deregulated jurisdictions)

#### Commodity Types <a id="commodity-types" href="#commodity-types" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

* `electricity` - Has data and/or functionality around utility electric services
* `natural_gas` - Has data and/or functionality around utility natural gas services
* `water` - Has data and/or functionality around utility water services

#### Capabilities <a id="capabilities" href="#capabilities" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

Below is the list of officially supported capabilities by the CDS Customer Data working group:

* `oauth` - See [`cdsc-wg1-02` (TODO)] - How Clients can register with the Server, as well as the primary method for obtaining customer consent
* `customer_data` - See [`cdsc-wg1-03` (TODO)] - How Clients can access authorized customer data using standarized API endpoints and formats

Servers can extend their list of capabilities with other non-CDS functionalities, but they MUST be prefixed with `extension_*`. For example, if the utility or entity provides connectivity for smart inverters (e.g. IEEE 1547) and wants to list that as a capability in its metadata, it can include something like `extension_ieee1547` as a capability, so that Clients who know how to interpret that capability can auto-discover it.

Clients MUST ignore any capabilities they do not recognize.

## Coverage Endpoint <a id="coverage-endpoint" href="#coverage-endpoint" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

This endpoint provides a structured metadata object on what territory, services, and customer
segments for which the utility or entity provides support (i.e. "what it covers").

The returned resource follows the [Coverage Structure](#coverage-structure).
