## What is LFESS? <a id="what-is-lfess" href="#what-is-lfess" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

In order to make sure our [specifications](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/specs) are free and open, we require that all contributers agree to membership terms of our Joint Development Foundation (JDF) project, called "LF Energy Standards and Specifications" (LFESS).

## Why do I need to join to contribute edits to specifications? <a id="why-join" href="#why-join" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

The LFESS membership agreement requires that contributors must make all contributions in an open manner, so that our specifications are free, accessible, and usable by everyone.
