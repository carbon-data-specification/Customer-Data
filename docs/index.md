# Customer Data Working Group (WG1)

This is the homepage of the [Customer Data Working Group (WG1)](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Customer-Data),
part of the
[Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/carbon-data-specification-cds/),
an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access,
in order to facilitate carbon emissions calculations and decarbonization efforts.

The scope of these specifications include, but are not limited to:

* Metering consumption and production data
* Account and bill data needed for project analysis
* Authorization and consent processes

See our git repository for the actual specifications under development:
