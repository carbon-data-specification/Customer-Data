## 1. Introduction <a id="introduction" href="#introduction" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

This specification was developed as part of the global effort to combat the climate crisis. Specifically, in order to scalably measure carbon emissions of organizations and calculate the impact of deploying and operating clean energy technologies, companies need an efficient means of requesting authorization for and accessing Customer data from utilities and other entities.

There are thousands of utilities serving Customers across the world, and each have their own way of providing access to and formatting Customer data. This specification defines a way for these utilities and other entities ("Servers") to provide a standardized, structured process for external users and companies ("Clients") to access Customer data, requesting authorization from Customers if needed. By offering a standardized a Customer data access protocol, utilities and other entities can enable secure interoperability with other external systems providing climate-change fighting services such as carbon tracking, decarbonization measures, grid flexibility capabilities, and energy benchmarking.

## 2. Terminology <a id="terminology" href="#terminology" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

<a id="server" href="#server" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a> **"Server"** - The entity hosting the specified endpoints. A Server can be an energy utility or another type of entity that want to provide access to privileged functionality or data. These entities can include, but are not limited to, distribution utilities, grid operators, electric retailers, community choice aggregators, government agencies, data warehouses, and private infrastructure providers.

<a id="client" href="#client" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a> **"Client"** - The entity requesting Server's metadata endpoints. A Client can be any organization or user seeking to access Customer data with a Server for a specific scope of access. These entities can include, but are not limited to, carbon tracking applications, electric vehicle companies, clean energy technology providers, commercial utility customers, grid management applications, and energy efficiency organizations.

<a id="customer" href="#customer" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a> **"Customer"** - The user who's data is being requested from a Server by a Client. For grants which require user authorization, the Customer is the user who authorizes the access. A Customer can be any utility or other entity account holders, such as homeowners, renters, businesses, and industrial customers.

If no Accounts are accessible, this value is an empty list (`[]`). If more than 100 Accounts are available to be listed, Servers MAY truncate the list and use the `next` value to link to the next segment of the list of Accounts.
* `next` - _URL_ or `null` - Where to request the next segment of the list of Accounts. If no next segment exists (i.e. the requester is at the end of the list), this value is `null`.
* `previous` - _URL_ or `null` - Where to request the previous segment of the list of Accounts. If no previous segment exists (i.e. the requester is at the front of the list), this value is `null`.

Servers MUST support Clients adding any of the following URL parameters to the `GET` request, which will filter the list of Accounts to be the intersection of results for each of the URL parameters filters:

* `cds_account_ids` - A space-separated list of `cds_account_id` values for which the Servers MUST filter the Accounts.
* `customer_numbers` - A space-separated list of `customer_number` values for which the Servers MUST filter the Accounts. Customer number values of `null` MUST be treated as invalid for this URL parameter filter (i.e. only populated `customer_number` values are available to be filtered using URL parameters).

### 12.1. Energy Attribute Certificate Object Format <a id="eac-format" href="#eac-format" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

EAC objects are formatted as JSON objects and contain the following named values:

* `cds_eac_id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) The Server's unique identifier for this EAC object.
* `cds_created` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (REQUIRED) When the Server created this EAC object.
* `cds_modified` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (REQUIRED) When the Server last modified this EAC object.
* `eac_number` - _string or `null`_ - (REQUIRED) The EAC identifier that a Client or Customer sees in Server documentation, Customer documents, or other interfaces as the identifier for this EAC, if available. If a Server does not have a Client or Customer-facing EAC identifier and the Client is not authorized to see the Server's internal EAC identifier for this EAC, or the Server does not have identifiers stored for this EAC, this value is `null`.
* `source_id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) The EAC's source identifier. The EAC source is defined as the organization who owns issuance of the EAC.
* `source_name` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) The EAC source's organization name.
* `destination_id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) The EAC's destination identifier. The EAC destination is defined as the organization responsible for retirement of the EAC.
* `destination_name` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) The EAC destination's organization name. For utilities that are operating their own Servers, this value is typically the name of the utility.
* `beneficiary_type` - _[BeneficiaryType](#eac-beneficiary-types)_ - (REQUIRED) The type of beneficiary to which this EAC is applied (e.g. an individual customer's PPA.
* `beneficiaries` - _Array[string]_ - (REQUIRED) The list of Customer identifier, rate plan, or program name to allocate the EAC.
* `asset_id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) The generation asset's identifier.
* `asset_origination` - _[AssetLocationType](#eac-asset-location-types)_ - (REQUIRED) From where the asset's generation is originated.
* `asset_destination` - _[AssetLocationType](#eac-asset-location-types)_ - (REQUIRED) To where the asset's generation is destined.
* `technology_type` - _[TechnologyType](#eac-technology-types)_ - (REQUIRED) The type of technology used for generating the EAC.
* `emissions_factor_direct` - _decimal_ - (REQUIRED) <span style="background-color:yellow">TODO:definition</span>.
* `emissions_factor_lca` - _decimal_ - (REQUIRED) <span style="background-color:yellow">TODO:definition</span>.
* `period_start` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (REQUIRED) When the EAC period started.
* `period_end` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (REQUIRED) When the EAC period ended or will end.
* `values` - _Array[[EnergyAttributeValues](#eac-values)]_

### 12.2. Beneficiary Types <a id="eac-beneficiary-types" href="#eac-beneficiary-types" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

EAC object `beneficiary_type` values MUST be one of the following:

* `customer` - Within the EAC's destination, the EAC is further applied to an individual Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a set of Customers. When the `beneficiary_type` is `customer`, the `beneficiaries` MUST have values of the relevant `customer_number` values. NOTE: listed `customer_number` values MUST be authorized to be visible to the Client, so while the destination MAY allocate beneficiaries of the EAC to multiple customers, only the customer numbers that are available to be seen as part of the Client's authorization MUST be listed.
* `account` - Within the EAC's destination, the EAC is further applied to an individual Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a set of Customer accounts. When the `beneficiary_type` is `account`, the `beneficiaries` MUST have values of the relevant `cds_account_id` values. NOTE: listed `cds_account_id` values MUST be authorized to be visible to the Client, so while the destination MAY allocate beneficiaries of the EAC to multiple accounts, only the accounts that are available to be seen as part of the Client's authorization MUST be listed.
* `servicecontract` - Within the EAC's destination, the EAC is further applied to an individual Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a set of Customer service contracts. When the `beneficiary_type` is `servicecontract`, the `beneficiaries` MUST have values of the relevant `cds_servicecontract_id` values. NOTE: listed `cds_servicecontract_id` values MUST be authorized to be visible to the Client, so while the destination MAY allocate beneficiaries of the EAC to multiple contracts, only the service contracts that are available to be seen as part of the Client's authorization MUST be listed.
* `rateplan` - Within the EAC's destination, the EAC is further applied to a rate plan or tariff for the customers with service contracts on that rate plan. When the `beneficiary_type` is `rateplan`, the `beneficiaries` MUST have the value of the relevant `rateplan_code` values. NOTE: listed `rateplan_code` values MUST be authorized to be visible to the Client, so while the destination MAY allocate beneficiaries of the EAC to multiple rate plans or tariffs, only the rate plans that are available to be seen as part of the Client's authorization MUST be listed.
* `program` - Within the EAC's destination, the EAC is further applied to a special program in which customers are participating. When the `beneficiary_type` is `program`, the `beneficiaries` MUST have the value of the relevant `program_id` values. NOTE: listed `program_id` values MUST be authorized to be visible to the Client, so while the destination MAY allocate beneficiaries of the EAC to multiple special programs, only the rate plans that are available to be seen as part of the Client's authorization MUST be listed.
* `general` - Within the EAC's destination, the EAC is applied generally to the base energy usage profile for all customers. When the `beneficiary_type` is `general`, the `beneficiaries` MUST be an empty list (`[]`).

### 12.3. Asset Location Types <a id="eac-asset-location-types" href="#eac-asset-location-types" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

EAC object `asset_origination` and `asset_destination` values MUST be one of the following:

* `grid` - The asset is located within the destination's local distribution grid.
* `region` - The asset is located within the destination's regional transmission operators' service territory.

### 12.4. Technology Types <a id="eac-technology-types" href="#eac-technology-types" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

EAC object `technology_type` values MUST be one of the following:

* `solar` - The asset's energy generation is from solar (photovoltaic or thermal).
* `wind` - The asset's energy generation is from wind.
* `hydro` - The asset's energy generation is from hydroelectric.
* `geothermal` - The asset's energy generation is from geothermal.
* `biomass` - The asset's energy generation is from biomass.
* `natural_gas` - The asset's energy generation is from natural gas.
* `coal` - The asset's energy generation is from coal.
* `oil` - The asset's energy generation is from fuel oil.

### 12.5. EAC Values <a id="eac-values" href="#eac-values" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

EAC value objects are formatted as JSON objects and contain the following named values:

* `eac_number` - _string or `null`_ - (REQUIRED) The EAC identifier that a Client or Customer sees in Server documentation, Customer documents, or other interfaces as the identifier for this EAC value, if available. If a Server does not have a Client or Customer-facing EAC identifier and the Client is not authorized to see the Server's internal EAC identifier for this EAC value, or the Server does not have identifiers stored for this EAC value, this value is `null`, and the EAC number for this value is assumed to be the value of the parent EAC object's `eac_number` (if any).
* `issued` - _ISO8601 date_ - (REQUIRED) What day the EAC value was issued.
* `retired` - _ISO8601 date or `null`_ - (REQUIRED) What day the EAC value was retired. If the EAC has not yet been retired, this value is `null`.
* `start` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (REQUIRED) When the EAC value period starts.
* `end` - _ISO8601 datetime_ - (REQUIRED) When the EAC value period ends.
* `unit` - _[Unit](#unit-types)_ - (REQUIRED) The unit of the EAC value's quantity.
* `value` - _[Unit](#unit-types)_ - (REQUIRED) The quantity of the EAC value.

### 12.6. Listing Energy Attribute Certificates <a id="eac-list" href="#eac-list" class="permalink">ðŸ”—</a>

Clients may request to list EAC objects that they have access to by making an HTTPS `GET` request, authenticated with a valid Bearer `access_token` that is scoped to provide access to a set of EACs, to the `cds_eacs_api` URL included in the [Client Registration Response](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/specs/cdsc-wg1-02#registration-response) or [Clients API](https://connectivity.carbondataspec.org/specs/cdsc-wg1-02#client-format). The EAC object listing request responses are formatted as JSON objects and contain the following named values.

* `eacs` - _Array[[EnergyAttributeCredit](#eac-format)]_ - (REQUIRED) A list of EACs to which the requesting `access_token` is scoped to have access. If no EACs are accessible, this value is an empty list (`[]`). If more than 100 EACs are available to be listed, Servers MAY truncate the list and use the `next` value to link to the next segment of the list of EACs.
* `next` - _URL_ or `null` - Where to request the next segment of the list of EACs. If no next segment exists (i.e. the requester is at the end of the list), this value is `null`.
* `previous` - _URL_ or `null` - Where to request the previous segment of the list of EACs. If no previous segment exists (i.e. the requester is at the front of the list), this value is `null`.

Servers MUST support Clients adding any of the following URL parameters to the `GET` request, which will filter the list of EACs to be the intersection of results for each of the URL parameters filters:

* `cds_eac_ids` - A space-separated list of `cds_eac_id` values for which the Servers MUST filter the EACs.
* `eac_numbers` - A space-separated list of `eac_number` values for which the Servers MUST filter the EACs.
* `before` - An ISO8601 datetime for which the Server MUST filter the EAC object `issuance_date` to values that are on or before this date.
* `after` - An ISO8601 datetime for which the Server MUST filter the EAC object `issuance_date` to values that are on or after this date.

Listings of EACs MUST be ordered in alphanumeric order by `eac_number`. In situations where relevant EACs have the same `eac_number`, those EACs with the same `eac_number` are further ordered in reverse chronological order by `issuance_date`, where the most recently issued EAC is first.
