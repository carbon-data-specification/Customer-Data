## Minutes
* Welcome and Intro
* Tour of split up websites and repos
* UtilityAPI/LF Energy won grant to create plan to deploy CDSC specs at SVCE!
    * https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2024/digitizing-utilities-prize-round-2-phase-1-winners-announced.html
* Feedback from LF on ISO tracks:
    * We need actual implementations as proof-points of spec utility prior to submitting to ISO
    * The ISO submission process takes ~6 months
* Events coming up: LF Energy Summit, maybe NARUC webinar
* Use Cases for Connectivity WG1
    * One use case: Enable other specifications that need connectivity
    * Examples:
        * CDSC-WG2 Power systems data
        * CDSC-WG3 Customer data
        * TROLIE
        * SAM
        * etc.
    * [Eloi] Could we make a list of audiences so folks know it's relevant to them?
        * [Daniel] great idea, also should we include a list of implementations that are targeting using these specs.
        * [Daniel] Make a new section for this instead of under use cases.
    * [Don] mailing list isn't public

## Closing Discussion
* Consensus to commit this to repo? Yes/No
