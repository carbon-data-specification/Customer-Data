## Minutes
* Take attendance and welcome
* Overview of progress on spec
    * Overview of what OAuth specs are included
    * What metadata fields from RFC 8414 are REQUIRED and no longer OPTIONAL/RECOMMENDED
        * [Eloi] depending on what scopes requested, the authorization process varies?
        * [Daniel] yes, (see client_admin example with client_credentials grant type)
    * What OAuth 2.0 extensions are required in CDSC-WG1-02:
        * Authorization Server Metadata (RFC8414)
        * Dynamic Client Registration (RFC7591)
        * Token Revocation (RFC7009)
        * Token Introspection (RFC7662)
        * Rich Authorization Requests (RFC9396)
        * Pushed Authorization Requests (RFC9126)
        * Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC7636)
        * [Jordan] Maybe have also components of Native Apps (RFC8252)?
    * Spec currently doesn't prohibit other RFC extensions (e.g. JWT stuff)
        * [Eloi] Doesn't allowing other methods risk more complexity?
            * [Daniel] I'm currently interpreting other extensions as "additive" as optional enhancements and not a requirement for Clients to accomodate. But if that's not the case, I agree that we should prohibit additional required Client behavior to get access to use the Server.
    * [Jordan] How do clients manage access?
        * [Daniel] Using the default "client_admin" scope and Scope Credentials API

## Closing Discussion
* Consensus to commit this to repo? Yes
