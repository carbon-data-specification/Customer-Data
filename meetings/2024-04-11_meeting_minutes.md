* Attendance and welcome

* EAC APIs

    * hourly EACs, do we need to use "segments" like usage?
    * [Eloi] how it works in EU
```
# Example EAC
* Volume: 100MWh
    * from prod_id 1234
    * issue date 2024-01-01
    * IDs meaning: 1MWh
    * EAC ids:
        * XXX-001
        * ...
        * XXX-100
```
    * [Hallie] see https://energytag.org/api/

* Usage Segments API
    * [Hallie] adding supplier mix to usage values (https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Customer-Data/pull/26#discussion_r1554439782)
```
    "segment_start": "2023-12-01T00:00:00Z",
    "segment_end": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "interval": 3600,
    "format": ["kwh_net", "kwh_fwd", "kwh_rev", "kwh_sources"],
    "values": [
        [
            {"v": 10.5},
            {"v": 10.5},
            {"v": 0.0},
            [
                {
                    "t": "fossil",
                    "v": 5.0,
                },
                {
                    "t": "solar",
                    "v": 2.5,
                    "cds_eac_id": "101010101-A",
                },
                {
                    "t": "wind",
                    "v": 3.0,
                },
            ],
        ],
        ...
    ],
```
    * [Hallie] EAC is the asset-level, and Usage Segments are at the usage-level, so may not be able to be linked.

* [Daniel] What is the EAC associated with (Service Contract? something else?)
    * [Hallie] depends on how the utility sets it up

* [Eloi] maybe would be good to have a mapping of potential use cases?
    * [Daniel] think that's a great idea
