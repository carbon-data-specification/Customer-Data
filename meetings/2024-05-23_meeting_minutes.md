## Minutes
* Welcome and intros
* Pivot to CDSC-WG1-03 comment review
    * [Kris] comment in pull request about CARE and FERA
        * discounted tariff programs
        * [Daniel] need to distinguish between account-level attributes and service-contract attributes that affect the rate/charges calculations
        * [Don] in SCE, CARE is the actual rate (not a modifier)
        * [Don] also life support was the plan name
    * [Don] will find hundreds of these across the country
    * [Daniel] Example: DRAM program in CA
        * [Kris] effects aren't shown on the bill, but are paid out separately
        * [Daniel] where should a note of the customer participating in this program live?
    * [Daniel] Another example: EV charging special time periods
    * [Daniel] Add catch-all list of `???` objects for Servers denoting additional attributes/flags/program participation
        * Should these be split out by type (e.g. rateplan modifiers vs. participation vs. ...)?
        * Should they a flat list with `type`?
        * Should they a flat list with no `type`?
        * Should the Server be required to disclose what strings _could_ be in this list on their metadata?

    * [Kris] Info on whether `meter_type` is for EV charging, etc.?

```
    * [Eloi] Utility may not have access to submeter data?
        * [Daniel] Correct, so maybe that needs to be in the registration requirements disclosure (that Server only provides Usage Segments for meters it owns)?
        * [Eloi] In EU, DSO may have access to main meter, but supplier may have their own submeter data.
        * [Don] For apartments, EV charging gets billed to building owner, not tenants.
