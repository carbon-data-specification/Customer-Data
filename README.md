# Customer Data WG

**Visit our website: https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/**

This repository is dedicated to the Customer Data Working Group. We focus on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access, in order to facilitate carbon emissions calculations and decarbonization efforts.

We are part of the [Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://carbondataspec.org/), an [LFEnergy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project at the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects).

## Scope

This working group focuses on writing free, open specifications for providing utility customer data access, in order to facilitate carbon emissions calculations and decarbonization efforts.

See the [Use Cases](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/use-cases) for which we are writing specifications to address, along with what data types and functionalities will need to be specified to accommodate those use cases.

See also the items specifically [not in scope](https://customerdata.carbondataspec.org/use-cases#not-in-scope).
